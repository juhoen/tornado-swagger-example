# Tornado Swagger implementation

Implement Swagger in your Tornado project. The related article can be found from [Medium](https://medium.com/@juhoenala/using-swagger-with-tornado-a6f051342718).

## Getting started

### Installing requirements

To run this application, you must have `pipenv` installed on your machine. If you are unfamiliar with Pipenv, I recommend reading through their [documentation](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). Installation guide can be found from [here](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today).

Now, you can install all the requirements by running

```sh
pipenv install
```

### Running the application

The application entry file is `app.py`. First, activate the virtual environment by running ...

```sh
$ pipenv shell
```

... and then, run the application ...

```sh
$ python app.py
```

## Note

Please note, that this project is purely written for example purposes. Having said that

- PEP8 violations might be present
- Proper testing is missing
- Lacking a proper database implementation
- Some error handlings might be missing for the sake of simplicity
